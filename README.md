# 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions & Docker (Local Deployment)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a full CI/CD pipeline using **GitHub Actions**, **Docker**, and **Docker Hub**, with deployment on a **local VM**. Every push to the `master` branch triggers a workflow that builds the Docker image, pushes it to Docker Hub, and allows it to be pulled and run locally.
